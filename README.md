## Installation
The only necessary library to install here are: plotly. 

There should be no other necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


## Project Motivation 
For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb data of Seattle to better understand:

Q1. Which factor influences the choice of a customer to book a location? 
Q2. Which factor influences the review score? 
Q3. Which factor influences the price? 
Q4. Can we predict future bookings, review scores and price per night? 


The full set of files related to this course are publicly available in this repository. 

## File Descriptions
There are 5 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. 
The file **01_Data_Preparation** must be run first, because it preprocesses the data, and creates two new .csv.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here] (https://medium.com/@fra.scipioni.83/are-you-a-airbnb-host-in-seattle-31472183a181).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Airbnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle).
